    "Thus, I started Batik Legend Charity Club, establishing the slogan “Commerce, Connection, Compassion” to organize charity speeches and sales on Danzhai’s traditional artwork. Two workshops were established in Danzhai, attracting eight adults back to the village for work and bringing their children parental company. I saw children’s eyes lighted by excitement. \n",
    "In the next year, I collaborated with other charity organizations for the Batik art sale and established a book corner in Danzhai. I saw children’s eyes brightened by curiosity. In year three, I established branches in Qingdao and Chengdu, bringing more people to join the cause and raising $5000. I saw the Batik art shining on the display. This year, four more village workshops were built, and we now have forty young people returning to the village working on Batik art. Each time I visited the village, I saw new eyes, glowing with passion, vitality, and gratefulness. \n",
